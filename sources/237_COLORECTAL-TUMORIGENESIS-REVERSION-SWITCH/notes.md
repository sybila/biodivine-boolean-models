### Modifications

The model is based on a list of functions provided as a `.csv` file. This `.csv` file is manually transformed into a `.bnet` model.

Afterwards, the following modifications were made to ensure logical consistency with the regulatory graph:
 - `NFIL3 -> DDIT3` was set to non-essential.
 - `MAFF -> KLF6` was set to non-essential.
 - `SREBF1 -> NFIA` was set to non-essential.
