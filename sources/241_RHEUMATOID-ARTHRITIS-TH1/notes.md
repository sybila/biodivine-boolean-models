### Modifications

The published model was not available at the time of publication. This model is a direct CaSQ translation of the `source.interaction.sbml` file, which is the interaction map.

Removed unused variables: `CD28`, `CD40LG_ITGAM_ITGB2_complex`, `CD84`, `COL4A5`, `ITGAM_ITGB2_complex`, `NOTCH1`, `TCR_CD3_complex`, `icos`.
