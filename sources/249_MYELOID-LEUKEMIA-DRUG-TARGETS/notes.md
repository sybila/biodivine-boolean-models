### Modifications

The model was downloaded as BMA file and then binarized/converted to AEON before performing any repairs.

Repairs:
 - Removed unused variables `v11_BcrAbl_b0`, `v22_Pag_aka_Msp23_b1`, `v22_Pag_aka_Msp23_b2`, `v21_Abi1_and_2_b1`, `v21_Abi1_and_2_b2` (might be a byproduct of binarization, but some of these do genuinely seem unused).
