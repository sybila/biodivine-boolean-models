### Modifications

Note that there are multiple variants of this model (they can all be found in the linked repository). Mainly, a smaller 3-cell variant, plus a simplified skin model, again with a 3-cell and 5-cell variants. We do not include all of these combinations because they are very similar.

The XML representation was converted to JSON using AEON. Then, the JSON was converted to .aeon where the following unused variables were removed: `v44_Ligand-in_b0`, `v71_Frizzled_b0`, `v141_Frizzled_b0`, `v167_Frizzled_b0`, `v255_Frizzled_b0`, `v268_Frizzled_b0`, `v289_Frizzled_b0`, `v302_Frizzled_b0`.
