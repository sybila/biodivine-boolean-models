### Modifications

The model is a semi-automatic merger of models 100 and 273. There are three merge methods (and, or, inhibitor wins). We use "inhibitor wins".

Also, the model contains several identity inputs. These were changed to unspecified: `DNMT3A`, `EXTERNAL_CYCLING`, `EXTERNAL_QUIESCENCE`, `FLT3`, `NPM1`.
