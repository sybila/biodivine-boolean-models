    "notes": "### Modifications\n\nThe model is an extension of the BBM model number 94. Since the authors do not provide a complete model and only list the functions for new nodes, the model is based on `source.base-model.aeon`, which is the model number 94.\n\nThe rules again contain a bunch of typos and do not agree fully with the regulatory graph (e.g. `MCSF` is used instead of `MCSFR`, regulations for `STAT3` are incomplete, ...). On many functions, the operator priority is also very weird... a slight modifications of operator priority were made to better reflect the descriptions of the processes that the authors give in the paper (perhaps missing parentheses?).\n\nTL;DR: This model was not easy to transform into anything machine readable, so please take it with a grain of salt.",
