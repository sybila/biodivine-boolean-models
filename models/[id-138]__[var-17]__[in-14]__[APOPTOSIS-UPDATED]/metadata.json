However, the model is only available as `.bnet`, so regulation data is not available. It could be largely taken from model no. 111 if desired.\n\nAlso, constant update functions of `CASP9_Cytoplasm_input`, `E`, `M`, `N`, `Orf3a`, `Orf3b`, `Orf6`, `Orf7a`, `Orf8a`, `Orf9b`, `S`, `TNF_TNFRSF1A_complex`, `TRADD`, `FAS_FASL_complex` were removed to make them canonical inputs.",
