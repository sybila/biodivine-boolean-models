Note that the output `EMT` node is technically multivalued, but this does not play due to it being an output, we thus only provide a Boolean abstraction. Note that regulation info is also available as part of the original publication (however, only as a larger network). We do not include it explicitly because the logical rules are created semi-automatically anyway - i.e. we do not expect to be an error in translation.\n\nFurthermore, following regulations were updated as non-essential because they do not have impact on the outcomes of the respective update functions (althugh note that for `EMT` this might be due to the Boolean abstraction):\n - `axin2 -> ctnnb1`\n - `mir_200b_3p -> emt`\n - `smad2 -> emt`\n - `smad4 -> emt`\n - `snai1 -> emt`\n - `smad2 -> myc`\n - `smad2 -> sp1`",
