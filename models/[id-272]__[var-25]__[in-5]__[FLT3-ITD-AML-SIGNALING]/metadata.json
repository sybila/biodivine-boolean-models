    "notes": "### Modifications\n\nThe model is taken from a different paper (https://github.com/IlyaLab/LogicModelMerger/tree/main) where it was translated to SBML. The original model files are also\navailable (https://github.com/SaccoPerfettoLab/FLT3-ITD_driven_AML_Boolean_models/tree/main), but are only listed in some R-specific format, so taking the SBML\nwas much easier. Also note that there are many versions of the model, as this is intended as patient-specific model. As such, this is only one possible version\namong all presented models.\n\nAlso, the .sbml model contained some syntax errors in update functions of model inputs `PTPN1`, `KIT`, `TNF`, `IGF1R`, `PDPK1`. These have been updated such that\nthe input variable simply has no transition object.\n\nFurthermore, dual regulations have been declared as two regulations (`MAP2K1 -> FLT3`, `PIK3CA -> MAP2K1`, `TSC2 -> PTEN`). These have been changed to dual, as per SBML spec.\n\nUpdate functions of `RPS6`, `RPS6KA1`, `PTPN11`, `KRAS` and `RPS6KB1` contained doubly-nested `<apply>` which has been removed.\n\nFinally, the following regulations were marked as non-essential:\n - TNF has no effect in FLT3.\n - MAPK8 has no effect in FLT3.\n - MAP2K1 has no effect in FLT3.\n - STAT3 has no effect in FLT3.\n - IGF1R has no effect in FLT3.\n - MAP2K1 has no effect in MAPK1.\n - FLT3 has no effect in MAPK14.\n - PIK3CA has no effect in MAP2K1.\n - MTOR has no effect in MAP2K1.\n - RPS6KB1 has no effect in MAP2K1.\n - IGF1R has no effect in IRS1.\n - PTPN1 has no effect in IRS1.\n - CBL has no effect in INSR.\n - KIT has no effect in GRB2.\n - GSK3B has no effect in PTEN.\n - CREB1 has no effect in PTEN.\n - TSC2 has no effect in PTEN.\n - RPS6KB1 has no effect in PTEN.\n - RPS6 has no effect in PTEN.\n - GSK3B has no effect in TSC2.\n - GSK3B has no effect in CREB1.",
